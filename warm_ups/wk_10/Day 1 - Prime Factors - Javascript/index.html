        <li>1 is not a prime number (it is not greater than 1).</li>
        <li>2 is a prime number (it is greater than one and is only evenly divisible by itself and 1).</li>
        <li>3 is a prime number (as above).</li>

      <p>What are the prime factors of 60?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 is not a prime number.</li>
        <li>2 is a prime number. 60 is evenly divisible by 2 (therefore <strong>2</strong> is a prime factor of 60), and leaves 30.</li>
        <li>30 is evenly divisible by 2 (therefore <strong>2</strong> is a prime factor of 60), and leaves 15.</li>
        <li>15 is not evenly divisible by 2.</li>
        <li>3 is the next prime number. 15 is evenly divisible by 3 (therefore <strong>3</strong> is a prime factor of 60), and leaves 5.</li>
        <li>4 is not a prime number.</li>
        <li>5 is a prime number. 5 is evenly divisible by 5 (therefore <strong>5</strong> is a prime factor of 50), and leaves 1.</li>
        <li>When we get to 1, we're done. </li>
        <li>The prime factors of 60 are <strong>2, 2, 3, 5</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can check this yourself:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2 * 2 * 3 * 5</li>
        <li>= 4 * 15</li>
        <li>= 60</li>
        <li>Success!</li>
      </ul>
