    if @num.length == 11 && @num[0] == "1" #@num.start_with?("1") is an alternative, but I prefer the array method.

    # elsif @num.length == 11 || @num.length == 9
    
    # Need to validate anything < 10 chars and over 10, ideally avoid cases checking for individual numbers (beyond or below 10)

    # One approach - not suggested, but might clarify what the captures are doing:
    # @matches = [[0..2], [3..5], [6..9]]

    # @matches = @num.match( /(\d{3})(\d{3})(\d{4})/ )

    # The format numbers need to return:
    # "(123) 456-7890"
