# Normalized Phone Number

Write a program that cleans up user-entered phone numbers so that they can be sent SMS messages.

The rules are as follows:

* If the phone number is less than 10 digits assume that it is bad number
* If the phone number is 10 digits assume that it is good
* If the phone number is 11 digits and the first number is 1, trim the 1 and use the first 10 digits
* If the phone number is 11 digits and the first number is not 1, then it is a bad number
* If the phone number is more than 11 digits assume that it is a bad number

We've provided tests, now make them pass.

Hint: Only make one test pass at a time. You can turn off tests by sending the message `skip` to it:

```ruby
def test_string_conversion
  skip
  assert_equal 1, "1".to_i
end
```
