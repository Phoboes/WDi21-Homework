    <p>Write a program that takes a word problem in the format:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>What is 5 plus -13?</p>
      <p>What is 7 minus 5?</p>
      <p>What is 5 plus 13 plus 6?</p>
      <p>What is 7 minus 5 minus 1?</p>
      <p>What is 9 minus 3 plus 5?</p>
      <p>What is 3 plus 5 minus 8?</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>and returns the answer as an integer.</p>
    <p>Your program should say "That's too complicated for me" if it gets a question it doesn't understand. </p>

    <li>Run tests by calling <code>ruby test.rb</code> in the terminal from the same folder that 'test.rb' is in (if you name it that).</li>
    <li>Write the bare minimum to get your tests passing.</li>
    <li>The tests guide the structure of your program, for instance <code>require_relative './word_problem'</code> is telling you it expects a file called 'word<em>problem.rb' in the same folder as the test. <code>WordProblem.new</code> indicates that the 'word</em>problem.rb' will need a class of that name and <code>.answer</code> on that class should return your results.</li>
