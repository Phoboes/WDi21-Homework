# Wordy Arithmetic Chains

Write a program that takes a word problem in the format:

> What is 5 plus -13?

> What is 7 minus 5?

> What is 5 plus 13 plus 6?

> What is 7 minus 5 minus 1?

> What is 9 minus 3 plus 5?

> What is 3 plus 5 minus 8?

and returns the answer as an integer.

Your program should say "That's too complicated for me" if it gets a question it doesn't understand. 

Use the [tests](https://gist.github.com/Phoboes/92fa8aeab5c586b929abbcfc8d78d013) to drive your solution by deleting the `skip` in one test at a time. 

## Extensions

Handle all permutations of plus, minus, multiplied by, and divided by.

Make sure you have failing tests for any code you implement.

#### Tips
- [Remember your regex notes](https://github.com/ga-wolf/wdi-21/blob/master/12-advanced/RegularExpressions/regular-expressions.pdf)
- Run tests by calling `ruby test.rb` in the terminal from the same folder that 'test.rb' is in (if you name it that).
- Write the bare minimum to get your tests passing.
- The tests guide the structure of your program, for instance `require_relative './word_problem'` is telling you it expects a file called 'word_problem.rb' in the same folder as the test. `WordProblem.new` indicates that the 'word_problem.rb' will need a class of that name and `.answer` on that class should return your results.
