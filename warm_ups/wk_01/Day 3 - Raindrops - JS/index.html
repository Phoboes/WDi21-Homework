        <p>Write a Javascript program that will take a number (eg <code>28</code> or <code>1755</code> or <code>9</code>, etc) and output the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>If the number contains 3 as a factor, output 'Pling'.</li>

            <li>If the number contains 5 as a factor, output 'Plang'.</li>

            <li>If the number contains 7 as a factor, output 'Plong'.</li>

            <li>If the number does not contain 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, output the number as a string.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>28 has 7 as a factor.


                <ul>
                    <li>In raindrop-speak, this would be a simple "Plong".</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>1755 has 3 and 5 as factors.


                <ul>
                    <li>In raindrop-speak, this would be a "PlingPlang".</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>34 has neither 3, 5 nor 7 as a factor.


                <ul>
                    <li>Raindrop-speak doesn't know what to make of that, so it just goes with the straightforward "34".</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
