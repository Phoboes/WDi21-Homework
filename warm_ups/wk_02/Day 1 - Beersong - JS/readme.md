## 99 bottles of beer

"99 Bottles of Beer" is a traditional reverse counting song. 


It is popular to sing on long trips, as it is repetitive and easy to memorize but -- it can take a long time to sing.


Lets try and make it run a little quicker using code:

The song's lyrics are as follows:

```
99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall...
```
The same verse is repeated, each time with one bottle fewer, until there are none left.

Bear in mind, not all verses are the same:

The verse for 1 bottle is as follows:

```
1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
Take it down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.
```

The verse for 0 bottles is as follows:

```
No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.
Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.
```

#### Bonus:

-  Count through any number of bottles.
- Be able to count between a range of numbers (ie, 20 to 10).
