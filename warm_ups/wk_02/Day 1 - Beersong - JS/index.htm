        <p>"99 Bottles of Beer" is a traditional reverse counting song. </p>

        <p>It is popular to sing on long trips, as it is repetitive and easy to memorize but -- it can take a long time to sing.</p>

        <p>Lets try and make it run a little quicker using code:</p>

        <p>The song's lyrics are as follows:</p>

        <pre><code>99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
      Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall...
      </code></pre>

        <p>The same verse is repeated, each time with one bottle fewer, until there are none left.</p>

        <p>Bear in mind, not all verses are the same:</p>

        <p>The verse for 1 bottle is as follows:</p>

        <pre><code>1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
      Take it down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.
      </code></pre>

        <p>The verse for 0 bottles is as follows:</p>

        <pre><code>No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.
      Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.
      </code></pre>

        <h4 id="bonus">Bonus:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Count through any number of bottles.</li>

            <li>Be able to count between a range of numbers (ie, 20 to 10).</li>
        </ul>
