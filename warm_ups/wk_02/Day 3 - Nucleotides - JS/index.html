        <p>DNA is represented by an alphabet of the following symbols: 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.</p>

        <p>Each symbol represents a nucleotide, which is a fancy name for the particular molecules that happen to make up a large part of DNA.</p>

        <p>Shortest intro to biochemistry EVAR:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>twigs are to birds nests as</li>

            <li>nucleotides are to DNA and RNA as</li>

            <li>amino acids are to proteins as</li>

            <li>sugar is to starch as</li>

            <li>oh crap lipids</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I'm not going to talk about lipids because they're crazy complex.</p>

        <p>So back to nucleotides.</p>

        <p>There are 5 types of nucleotides. 4 of these occur in DNA: <code>A</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>G</code>, and <code>T</code>. 4 occur in RNA: <code>A</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>G</code>, <code>U</code>.</p>

        <p>There are no other nucleotides.</p>

        <p>Make sure that you validate it has nucleotides!</p>

        <p>Find how many of each nucleotides are in a string that you pass in to a function</p>
