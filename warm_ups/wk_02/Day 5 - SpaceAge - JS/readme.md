# Age

Write a program that, given an age in seconds, calculates how old someone is in standard Earth years.

Then use the program to answer the following question:
_If I am 1031 million seconds old, how old am I?_

## Extensions

Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on:
   - Mercury (orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years)
   - Venus (orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years)
   - Mars (orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years)
   - Jupiter (orbital period 11.862615 Earth years)
   - Saturn (orbital period 29.447498 Earth years)
   - Uranus (orbital period 84.016846 Earth years)
   - Neptune (orbital period 164.79132 Earth years)

An Earth year is roughly 365.25 days, or 31557600 seconds.
