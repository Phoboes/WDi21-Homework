        <p>An allergy test produces a single numeric score which contains the information about all the allergies the person has (that they were tested for).</p>
        <p>The list of items (and their value) that were tested are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>eggs (1)</li>
        <li>peanuts (2)</li>
        <li>shellfish (4)</li>
        <li>strawberries (8)</li>
        <li>tomatoes (16)</li>
        <li>chocolate (32)</li>
        <li>pollen (64)</li>
        <li>cats (128)</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <p>So if Tom is allergic to peanuts and chocolate, he gets a score of 34.</p>
        <p>Now, given just that score of 34, your program should be able to say:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Whether Tom is allergic to any one of those allergens listed above.</li>
        <li>All the allergens Tom is allergic to.</li>
        </ul>
