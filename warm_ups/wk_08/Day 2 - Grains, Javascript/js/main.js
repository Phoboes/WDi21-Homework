// # The wheat and chessboard problem
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// There is a legend about the invention of chess in which a man presents his game to an Indian prince.
// Impressed by the game, the prince offers the wise man a reward of his choosing.

// The man states:

// "I wish for a grain of wheat and a chess board. On the first square of the board, give me one grain of wheat -- for every square on the chessboard, give me the double the number of grains as the square before. Do this for all 64 squares on the board."

// On first hearing this sum, the prince considered it trivial sum and agreed, thinking the man a fool -- until his advisors actually calculated the total he would actually owe.

// He later has the man executed for trying to bankrupt the kingdom. I love a happy ending.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// #### Task

// Write a program that can calculate the total number of wheat grains that would be owed to the man by the end of the board.

// ____

// #### Tips:

// `Math.pow()`, try use underscore (especially range and reduce).

// #### Bonus trivia:
// This is a *really* old story, first mentioned in 1256, however chess was invented somewhere around 600 AD (still in India).

var grains = {

  // Process:
  // Generate a board to represent our imaginary chessboard.

  // Underscore's '.range' makes this pretty easy for us => http://underscorejs.org/#range
  // 1 is our starting index, 65 is actually the value where the range stops (we want 64)
  board: function(){
    return _.range(1,65);
  },


  // Create a function that can get me an exponent of 2 for any given number by the index before it on the board.

    // Math.pow takes a base as the first argument, and an exponent as the second. => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/pow
    // We want exponents of 2, and we want it to reference the *previous* index on the board, so we always knock 1 off the given number.
  square: function( num ){
    return Math.pow( 2, num - 1 );
  },

// Create a function to transfer this information into an array for each index

  // _.each expects a list as a first argument, and a function as a second to work with that list. => http://underscorejs.org/#each

  // In this case, I rely on the `board` function to immediately create an array from [1, ..., 64], then begin iterating it.
  // Within the _.each `this` is no longer bound to the grains object. Fortunately, we can just reference the object directly, hence 'grains.square'
  boardSums: function(){
    var output = [];
    _.each( this.board(), function( boardIndex ){
      output.push( grains.square( boardIndex ) );
    });
    return output;
  },


  // Reduce the provided array to a base sum
  // _.reduce expects a list, a function to process that list, and an optional parameter called a 'memo' => http://underscorejs.org/#reduce
  // Sum refers to that starting memo (beginning at 0), num refers to the value of the current index.
  // For all of the numbers, we add them to the total sum
  totalSum: function(){
    return _.reduce( this.boardSums(), function( sum, num ){
      return sum + num;
    }, 0);
  }
  
};
