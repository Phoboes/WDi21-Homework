      <p>There is a legend about the invention of chess in which a man presents his game to an Indian prince.
      Impressed by the game, the prince offers the wise man a reward of his choosing.</p>

      <p>The man states:</p>

      <p>"I wish for a grain of wheat and a chess board. On the first square of the board, give me one grain of wheat -- for every square on the chessboard, give me the double the number of grains as the square before. Do this for all 64 squares on the board."</p>

      <p>On first hearing this sum, the prince considered it trivial sum and agreed, thinking the man a fool -- until his advisors actually calculated the total he would actually owe.</p>

      <p>He later has the man executed for trying to bankrupt the kingdom. I love a happy ending.</p>

      <h4 id="task">Task</h4>

      <p>Write a program that can calculate the total number of wheat grains that would be owed to the man by the end of the board.</p>
