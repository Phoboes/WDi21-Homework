# The wheat and chessboard problem

There is a legend about the invention of chess in which a man presents his game to an Indian prince.
Impressed by the game, the prince offers the wise man a reward of his choosing.

The man states:

"I wish for a grain of wheat and a chess board. On the first square of the board, give me one grain of wheat -- for every square on the chessboard, give me the double the number of grains as the square before. Do this for all 64 squares on the board."

On first hearing this sum, the prince considered it trivial sum and agreed, thinking the man a fool -- until his advisors actually calculated the total he would actually owe.

He later has the man executed for trying to bankrupt the kingdom. I love a happy ending.

#### Task

Write a program that can calculate the total number of wheat grains that would be owed to the man by the end of the board.
