  <ul>
  <li>I've done a lot of it for you.</li>

  <li>All that is required is to plug in some extra bits and bobs that you have already seen before, or to reuse content that is already there.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="thebadnews">The bad news:</h4>

  <ul>
  <li>I've done a lot of it for you.</li>

  <li>Reading code is often <em>harder</em> than writing it -- and I haven't annotated this at all (yet). Spend a little bit of time trying to understand roughly what is happening, and how things are separated (objects within objects). Calling the <code>app</code> variable in the console may help with this.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This warm-up was inspired by my etch-a-sketch warmup from the other day. There is nothing in here that you haven't seen before; there's just a bit more logic behind the scenes.</p>

  <ul>
  <li><p>1: Currently, our poor snek is blind. As you can see, as soon as we begin our program, he careens off into a wall and dies. Modify the code to accept a user's input (WASD) to guide snek away from walls and self harm, to the loving embrace of junk food (and inevitable death). </p></li>

  <li><p>2: If snek dies, there is currently no way to reset the game. Add a reset button.</p></li>

  <li><p>3: Snek is now on a diet. Add a score so it can keep track of how many things it's eaten.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Tips:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><p>Task 1: Look at the etch-a-sketch code if you've forgotten how I wrote key detection. Feel free to steal it. To see what you should be changing, look at both the snake object and the <code>directionStep</code> function.</p></li>

  <li><p>Task 2: The code for this is already there. Have a look for something that is already resetting things -- then tie it to an HTML button or something.</p></li>

  <li><p>Task 3: I've coded none of this -- you are on your own.</p></li>
