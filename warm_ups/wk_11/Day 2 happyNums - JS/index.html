      <p>A happy number is defined by the following process:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Starting with any positive integer, </li>
      <li>replace the number by the <em>sum of the squares of its digits</em>, and</li>
      <li>repeat the process until </li>
      <li>the number equals 1 (where it will stay),</li>
      <li>or it loops endlessly in a <em>repeating</em> cycle which does not include 1.   </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers,
      while those for which this process do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers.</p>
