    <hr />

    <p>The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit.</p>

    <p>A prime number is a natural number that has exactly two distinct natural number divisors: 1 and itself.</p>

    <p>Create your range, starting at two and ending at the given limit.</p>

    <p>The algorithm consists of repeating the following over and over:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>take the next available unmarked number in your list (it is prime)</li>

    <li>remove all the multiples of that number (they are not prime)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Repeat until you don't have any possible primes left in your range.</p>

    <p>When the algorithm terminates, all the numbers in the list that have not been removed are prime.</p>
