    <p>Donald is the author of the series of books
      called The Art of Computer Programming.
      <p>He also created the software TeX, to allow anybody to produce
      high-quality books using minimal effort,
      and to provide a system that would
      give exactly the same results on all computers,
      at any point in time
    </p>
    </p>
    <p> He is so much more than those 2 paragraphs though, he also
      is in the midst of creating a multimedia work called Fantasia
      Apocalyptica. Which he intends to premiere to the world on his 80th Birthday
      next year.</p>
