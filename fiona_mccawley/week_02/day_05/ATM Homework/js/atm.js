// JavaScript Bank

//
// In this homework, you'll create a basic bank in Javascript.
// The bank has many accounts and the following capabilities that you need to write.
//
// Bank
//
// There is only one bank. This bank has an array of accounts.

// The bank needs a method that will return the total sum of money in the accounts.

// It also needs an addAccount method that will enroll a new account at the bank
  // and add it to the array of accounts.

// There is no need to create additional functions of the bank to delete accounts, etc.
//
// The bank has many accounts.

// Accounts should be objects that all share a set of common functionality.
//
// Accounts
//
// Accounts have a
    // current balance and
      // owner's name.
        //You should be able to deposit
        //or withdraw from an account to change the balance.
//
// There is no need to write a user interface. Make sure functions return values -- you may also have your functions console.log() values to help you see your code working.
//
// You should write a basic story through a series of JavaScript commands that shows that the methods do indeed work as expected: add some accounts, show the total balance, make some deposits and withdrawals, show the new total balance.
//
// Tips
//
// Don't overthink this. Shorter code is probably the answer.

var account = {
  name: "test",
  balance: 0,
  deposit: function () {
    console.log("deposit");
  },
  withdraw: function () {
    console.log("withdraw");
  }
};

var addAccount = function () {

};
