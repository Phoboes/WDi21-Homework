// The Book List
// Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!
// Create a webpage with an h1 of "My Book List".
// Add a script tag to the bottom of the page, where all your JS will go.
// Copy this array of books:
// var books = [
//   {
//     title: 'The Design of EveryDay Things',
//     author: 'Don Norman',
//     alreadyRead: false
//   },
//   {
//     title: 'The Most Human Human',
//     author: 'Brian Christian',
//     alreadyRead: true
//   }
// ];
// Iterate through the array of books. For each book, create a p element with the book title and author and append it to the page.
// Bonus: Use a ul and li to display the books.
// Bonus: add a property to each book with the URL of the book cover, and add an img element for each book on the page.
// Bonus: Change the style of the book depending on whether you have read it or not.
