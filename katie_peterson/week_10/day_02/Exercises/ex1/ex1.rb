# Make a program that prints each line of its input that mentions fred. (It shouldnâ€™t do anything for other lines of input.) Does it match if your input string is Fred, frederick, or Alfred? Make a small text file with a few lines mentioning "fred flintstone" and his friends, then use that file as input to this program and the ones later in this section.

require 'pry'
# ruby boilerplate.rb data.txt
# ARGF will refer to data.txt
  #When we iterate through it, we are going line by line through that file.
ARGF.each do |line|
  if line =~ /fred/
    puts line
  end
end
